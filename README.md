# Public-Ledger-Donation-Base-Network-
This repository documents the PublicLedger smart contract deployed on the Base network. This contract serves as a simple, public donation ledger, designed to accept direct ETH transfers from users and publicly log the transactions. The collected funds are securely stored in the contract balance for the owner to withdraw later.
